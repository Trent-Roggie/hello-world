Git-Hub Tutorial

Hello World!

Trent Roggie speaking 'ere. If you are reading this README filed, and are not my professor for this course:
Why are you here?

There is no interesting code, no fresh ideas, nothing to steal. Just words, nothing executable.

To my professor: Hi! Thanks for dropping by, although I know it is your job and all, it is good to see ya here.

To everything else: Why are you still reading this! Bugger Off!

Ta-ta, 
Trent R.
